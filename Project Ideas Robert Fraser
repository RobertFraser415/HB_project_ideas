My strongest idea is to use the WALMART API’s that are already in existence to create an interesting web application that benefits WALMART and ultimately the customers. Not sure exactly what that means or how yet but that’s what I want to do. 
My other ideas and goals might be:

 “Walmart means low prices” , So…..

I want to create a price comparing interface that takes a keyword and searches for that item and finds me the cheapest priced at Walmart  and then compare those to Walmarts competitors prices to make sure we are the lowest price. 
Then I want to compare THAT to wether the cost in gas is worth the trip at the alternate retailer.

Possibly a mock "PRICE MATCHED" THING thats interactive but not hooked up to a real stripe.

I want the search results to compare the similar items so I can sort them by price and specific differences and quickly select for a less time consuming shopping experience of comparing myself.

I want to create a "fake" call to action button for sales where Walmart gets paid and the item is " ON ITS WAY " and thats the end lol 

I want to create micro services for quick sales of items needed for specific ventures (ex. a plant enthusiast on You Tube quickly selling theres or Walmarts products such as seeds / pots / soil)    
Like a pop up component or web app component you can plug and play that sells the specific items your discussing or using for the people watching on you tube during the video.
(ie “Pause the video and get the gear/ merch / “stuff you need”) not a link that takes you away from the page  but a financial transaction widget sort of that allows you to stay immersed in your viewing youtube experience.

Create an API to submit new products for review to be sold by WALMART possibly a sorting algorithm to get items ready to be reviewed or auto rejected for certain criteria. Trying to make more GREEN and eco sustainable products available
